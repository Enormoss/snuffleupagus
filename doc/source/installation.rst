Installation
============

Snuffleupagus is tested against `various PHP 7+ versions <https://travis-ci.org/nbs-system/snuffleupagus/>`_.

Manual installation
-------------------

Depending on the system, we might already offer binary packages.
You can check our :doc:`download`. In that case you only need to activate
the extension inside your ``php.ini`` and to configure it.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only dependency (at least on Debian) to compile Snuffleupagus is
`php7.0-dev <https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=php7.0-dev>`_ or onwards.

Quickstart
^^^^^^^^^^

::

    git clone https://github.com/nbs-system/snuffleupagus
    cd snuffleupagus/src
    phpize
    ./configure --enable-snuffleupagus
    make
    make install

This should install the ``snuffleupagus.so`` file in your extension directory.
The final step is adding a load directive and to specify the location of the
:doc:`configuration file <config>`, either in a ``conf.d/20-snuffleupagus.ini``
file, or directly in you ``php.ini`` if you prefer:

::

    extension=snuffleupagus.so

    # This is only an example,
    # you can place your rules wherever you want.
    sp.configuration_file=/etc/php/conf.d/snuffleupagus.rules


Be careful, on some distribution, there are separate configurations for
cli/fmp/cgi/â€¦ be sure to edit the right one.

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading the Snuffleupagus is as simple as recompiling it (or using a binary), replacing the file and restarting your webserver.
